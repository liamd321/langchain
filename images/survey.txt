On a scale of 1-10, what was your confidence with LLMs, LangChain, RAG, and agentic AI before working through the notebooks, where 0 is never heard of it, 
5 is knowing a decent amount or theory, 7 is being able to implement some stuff and 10 is you could write the documentation
LLMs:1-10
LangChain:1-10
RAG:1-10
agentic AI:1-10
Now do the same after working through the notebooks:
LLMs:1-10
LangChain:1-10
RAG:1-10
agentic AI:1-10

The point of this survey is to improve the notebooks before they are due as they are unfinished and we need to add a couple more, so please provide any free text reponse,
keeping in mind, this is meant to be a practical activity, where the student learns by doing, in order to equip them with skills and knowledge.
