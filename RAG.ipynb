    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, you learned the building blocks of creating an LLM chain using langchain, and built your first small AI chatbot using langchain!\n",
    "\n",
    "This was done using a model provided by a distributor, and as such has been pre-trained on data that we can't change. So unfortunately it's a larger task to get these models to do things they weren't trained to do. As a matter of fact, this is a problem that researchers are still struggling with and [exploring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01203).\n",
    "Some consider this ability of a model to learn new data, specifically after it has been trained, to be the definition of intelligence that artificial intelligence should strive for. \n",
    "In order to progress professional fields in a dynamic world, it would be super useful to have this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few tools to tackle this, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fine tuning\n",
    "    - Involves removing a small subset of the [weights](https://artificialintelligenceschool.com/understanding-weights-in-large-language-models/#2-the-anatomy-of-weights-in-neural-networks) of a model, and re-training these weights over a few [epochs](https://aiwiki.ai/wiki/Epoch) (training cycles) on new data. That is, re-training part of the model to do something new that you would like it to do.\n",
    "    - Is limited due to the [compute](https://www.lleverage.ai/glossary/compute) required to retrain the model, as well as the amount of times you can retrain the model without running into something called [catastrophic forgetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_interference)! Oh no! This means that the model starts to lose it's fundamental functionality because of the process described above, the weights that enable the model to function are forgotten so much so that the model fails to remain useful.\n",
    "2. In-context learning\n",
    "    - This is where the user (you) gives the model feedback on how well it's doing a task, which lets the model change it's output without changing the weights, something only thought possible in the past 5 years.\n",
    "    - But who wants to do that? This approach is called few-shot learning and not only takes a few messages back and forth with the chatbot, but is more limited the less similar the required task is to the model's [modus operandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi). What we really want is [zero-shot learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning) where you don't have to interact with the model at all before it's ready to answer your questions and do your bidding! How goods that.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *RAG*\n",
    "   - This is similar to the context we were providing when prompting models in the last document, however when the information eclipses a few pages, it soon becomes impractical to give the model this data every time you want an output.\n",
    "   - Instead of expanding what's called the '[context window](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/context-window)' of your model, in order to be able to 'remember' all of the data that you have passed it (every time that you prompt the model), RAG uses a pre-processing method to be able to identify which parts of your data it needs to access to answer your question.\n",
    "   - LangChain splits your data down into small chunks that contain some [semantic meaning as embeddings](#embeddings), and uses this semantic representation to  quickly search your data for the chunk of data that is relevant to your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial document will take you through pre-processing and manipulating your data using LangChain and then using it with your model."
