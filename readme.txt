This document is a practical guide to the basic useage of LangChain, to equip you with the skills to understand and create agents using LangChain and LangGraph and be expanded on in further docs. This is unfortunately not going to equip you with the nitty gritty knowledge of artificial neurons, neural networks, or other architecutres like transformers or CNNS. These subjects are too large to tackle in this workshop, and ECE4179 already covers this content as a part of university coursework. If this was to become more official, this class would be a 4/5 level, with seperately marked assessments, and the having 4719 as a prereq.
